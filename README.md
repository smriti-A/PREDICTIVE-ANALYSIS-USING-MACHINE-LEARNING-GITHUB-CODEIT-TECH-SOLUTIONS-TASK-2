DESCRIPTION:  This task demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering to segment mall customers based on their income and spending behavior. By leveraging data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization techniques, we gain valuable insights into customer segments, which can inform marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.The first step involves loading the dataset using the Pandas library. We handle potential file-related errors gracefully, ensuring that the user is informed if the dataset is not found. Once the data is loaded, we conduct a preliminary exploration to understand its structure and contents. This includes checking the data types, viewing the first few rows, and obtaining summary statistics. Such exploratory data analysis (EDA) is crucial as it helps identify the nature of the data, the presence of any missing values, and the distribution of key features.
